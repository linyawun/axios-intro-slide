# Basic Axios Usage

<div class='note-block'>
  This axios example and source code version uses v1.8.4
</div>

- Direct axios request
  - `axios(config)`
    ```js
    axios({
      method: 'get',
      url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1',
      headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar' },
    });
    ```
  - `axios(url[, config])`
    ```js
    axios('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', {
      headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar' },
    });
    ```
  - `axios.requestMethod`
    ```js
    axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');
    ```

---

# Basic Axios Usage

- Create an axios instance for requests
  ```js
  const apiClient = axios.create({
    baseURL: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com',
    timeout: 5000,
    headers: { 'X-Custom-Header': 'foobar' },
  });
  apiClient.get('/posts/1').then((res) => console.log(res.data));
  ```

1. `createInstance`
<div class='ml-6'>

```js
function createInstance(defaultConfig) {
  const context = new Axios(defaultConfig); //  creates a new Axios instance

  // Copy axios.prototype to instance
  utils.extend(instance, Axios.prototype, context, { allOwnKeys: true });
  // Copy context to instance
  utils.extend(instance, context, null, { allOwnKeys: true });

  // Factory for creating new instances
  instance.create = function create(instanceConfig) {

  };
  return instance; //  instance is both a function AND an object

### axios is exported in <a href='https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/axios.js' target='_blank' class='hover:text-[#c5c3fb]!'>lib/axios.js</a>

1. `createInstance`
<div class='ml-6'>

`createInstance` function creates an Axios instance that functions both as a function and an object:

1. Creates a base `Axios` instance (context)
2. Binds `Axios.prototype.request` to context as the main request function
<div class='ml-6'>

- When calling `axios(config)`, it internally executes `Axios.prototype.request.bind(context)(config)`, making the main request function bound to the correct context
</div>

3. Extends instance to include:
<div class='ml-6'>

- Methods from Axios prototype chain (`get`, `post`, etc.)
- Configuration and state from context
</div>

4. Provides `create` method for new instances with merged custom configs

</div>

2. Create Default Axios Instance

<div class='ml-6'>

```js
const axios = createInstance(defaults);
```

- Creates an axios instance with default configuration, this is the instance we use directly

</div>

3. Extend Axios Instance with Additional Properties and Methods

<div class='ml-6'>

```js
// ...
axios.spread = spread;

// Expose isAxiosError
axios.isAxiosError = isAxiosError;

// Expose mergeConfig
axios.mergeConfig = mergeConfig;

axios.AxiosHeaders = AxiosHeaders;
// ..
```

- `AxiosInstance` doesn't define a `create` method, so can the instance returned by `axios.create` call `create`?

  - In TypeScript type checking, using `AxiosInstance.create` will show an error
    <img src='/image/axiosInstance-create-TS.jpg'/>
  - In JavaScript runtime, using `AxiosInstance.create` still works

    ```js
    const instance1 = axios.create({...});
    const instance2 = instance1.create({...});
    instance2.get('/posts/1').then((res) => console.log(res.data)); // Successfully prints data
    ```

    > The `createInstance` called by `axios.create` assigns a function to `instance.create`

# Axios URL Encoding

- What does Axios do for us?
  - The `params` object is automatically converted to query strings
  - Uses [`encodeURIComponent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent) for encoding by default
  - Supports [`paramsSerializer`](https://github.com/axios/axios?tab=readme-ov-file#request-config) for customization

axios URL Á∑®Á¢ºÂú® [`lib/helpers/buildURL.js`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/helpers/buildURL.js)

### When does Axios call [`buildURL`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/helpers/buildURL.js)?

When you call `axios.get()`, here's what happens:

1. The request starts in the Axios class's` _request` method ([`lib/core/Axios.js`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/core/Axios.js)). This is the core method that handles all requests.
2. Inside `_request`, after handling interceptors, it calls `dispatchRequest` :
<div class='ml-6'>
```js {all|5}{maxHeight:'120px'}
// lib/core/Axios.js
_request(configOrUrl, config) {
    // ... 
    try {
      promise = dispatchRequest.call(this, newConfig);
    } catch (error) {
      return Promise.reject(error);
    }
    // ...
}
```
</div>

### When does Axios call [`buildURL`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/helpers/buildURL.js)?
3. [`dispatchRequest`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/core/dispatchRequest.js) then gets the appropriate adapter (XHR for browsers, HTTP for Node.js) and calls it:

<div class='ml-6'>
```js {all|5}{maxHeight:'250px'}
// lib/core/dispatchRequest.js
export default function dispatchRequest(config) {
    // ...
    const adapter = adapters.getAdapter(config.adapter || defaults.adapter);
      return adapter(config).then(function onAdapterResolution(response) {
        throwIfCancellationRequested(config);
        // Transform response data
        response.data = transformData.call(
          config,
          config.transformResponse,
          response
        );
        response.headers = AxiosHeaders.from(response.headers);
        return response;
      }
    // ...
}
```
</div>

# Axios URL Encoding - üîç Source Code



### When does Axios call [`buildURL`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/helpers/buildURL.js)?
4. For browser environments, it uses the XHR adapter ([`lib/adapters/xhr.js`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/adapters/xhr.js)). The first thing the XHR adapter does is call `resolveConfig`


<div class='ml-6'>
```js {all|4}{maxHeight:'100px'}
// lib/adapters/xhr.js
function (config) {
  return new Promise(function dispatchXhrRequest(resolve, reject) {
    const _config = resolveConfig(config);
    // ...
});
}
```
</div>

5. [`resolveConfig`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/helpers/resolveConfig.js) is where the URL and params are processed. This is where your params get encoded:

<div class='ml-6'>
```js {all|4}{maxHeight:'100px'}
// lib/helpers/resolveConfig.js
export default (config) => {
// ...
    newConfig.url = buildURL(
      buildFullPath(newConfig.baseURL, newConfig.url, newConfig.allowAbsoluteUrls), 
      config.params, 
      config.paramsSerializer
    );
// ...
}
```
</div>

### What does [`buildURL`](https://github.com/axios/axios/blob/v1.x/lib/helpers/buildURL.js) do?

- Purpose: takes a base URL and appends query parameters to it in a properly encoded format.
- Parameters:
    - `url`: The base URL (e.g., `"http://www.google.com"`)
    - `params`: An object containing the query parameters to append
    - `options`: Optional configuration for how to encode/serialize the parameters
        - Can be an object containing serialize function or encode function
        - Can also be directly passed as a serialize function

# Shiki Magic Move

Powered by [shiki-magic-move](https://shiki-magic-move.netlify.app/), Slidev supports animations across multiple code snippets.

Add multiple code blocks and wrap them with <code>````md magic-move</code> (four backticks) to enable the magic move. For example:

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```ts {*|2|*}
// step 1
const author = reactive({
  name: 'John Doe',
  books: [
    'Vue 2 - Advanced Guide',
    'Vue 3 - Basic Guide',
    'Vue 4 - The Mystery',
  ],
});
```

```ts {*|1-2|3-4|3-4,8}
// step 2
export default {

# Components

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

You can use Vue components directly inside your slides.

We have provided a few built-in components like `<Tweet/>` and `<Youtube/>` that you can use directly. And adding your custom components is also super easy.

```html
<Counter :count="10" />
```

<!-- ./components/Counter.vue -->
<Counter :count="10" m="t-4" />

Check out [the guides](https://sli.dev/builtin/components.html) for more.

</div>
<div>

```html
<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" />
```

<Tweet id="1390115482657726468" scale="0.65" />

</div>
</div>

<!--
Presenter note with **bold**, *italic*, and ~~striked~~ text.

Also, HTML elements are valid:
<div class="flex w-full">
  <span style="flex-grow: 1;">Left content</span>
  <span>Right content</span>
</div>
-->

# Themes

Slidev comes with powerful theming support. Themes can provide styles, layouts, components, or even configurations for tools. Switching between themes by just **one edit** in your frontmatter:

<div grid="~ cols-2 gap-2" m="t-2">

```yaml
---
theme: default
---
```

```yaml
---
theme: seriph
---
```

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-default/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

<img border="rounded" src="https://github.com/slidevjs/themes/blob/main/screenshots/theme-seriph/01.png?raw=true" alt="">

</div>

# Clicks Animations

You can add `v-click` to elements to add a click animation.

<div v-click>

This shows up when you click the slide:

```html
<div v-click>This shows up when you click the slide.</div>
```

</div>

<br>

<v-click>

The <span v-mark.red="3"><code>v-mark</code> directive</span>
also allows you to add
<span v-mark.circle.orange="4">inline marks</span>
, powered by [Rough Notation](https://roughnotation.com/):

```html
<span v-mark.underline.orange>inline markers</span>
```

</v-click>

<div mt-20 v-click>

# Motions

Motion animations are powered by [@vueuse/motion](https://motion.vueuse.org/), triggered by `v-motion` directive.

```html
<div

  :enter="{ x: 0 }"
  :click-3="{ x: 80 }"
  :leave="{ x: 1000 }"

```

<div class="w-60 relative">
  <div class="relative w-40 h-40">
